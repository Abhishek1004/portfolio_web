    "bio": "I am a pretty vanilla dude who codes and enjoys learning anything new. I prefer order and consistency over spontaneity. I have been coding for a substantial amount of time in languages like Python and Java. My interests lie in Data Science and related fields like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and also in areas related to Web Development. Whenever possible, I like to learn new technologies and improve my knowledge on Node.js and React.js. My hobbies include working out, reading, listening music and exploring new places. Oh and I am a casual gamer too. For my side hustle, I try learning about Stock Markets and investing as much as possible.",
